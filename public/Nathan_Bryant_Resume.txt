PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Nathan Bryant — Engineering Leader | Embedded Systems Architect | Inventor

Multidisciplinary engineer with a track record of designing and delivering complex, high-performance systems that bridge electronics, firmware, and mechanical integration. Over my career, I've led projects from concept to production, building proprietary platforms that push the limits of accuracy, reliability, and usability in demanding industrial environments.

At TigerStop, I was the lead designer of a patented embedded ecosystem for material processing systems. These platforms achieved linear positioning accuracy within 100 microns while moving loads over a ton, seamlessly integrating with standard industrial equipment over CAN bus, RS protocols, and EtherCAT. I was responsible for component selection, PCB layout, prototyping, and firmware development, ensuring that the system architecture met both performance and manufacturability goals.

Beyond my technical execution, I've led cross-disciplinary teams, navigated ERP migrations, co-founded a design-build company specializing in restoring historic architecture, and explored applications of EEG-based neurofeedback for wellness and clinical use. My work spans automation, manufacturing, neurotechnology, and R&D leadership, but my focus is constant: building systems that work—technically, strategically, and humanely.

I thrive where innovation meets execution, and where bold ideas need to be turned into robust, real-world solutions.
